## 📋 IMMEDIATE NEXT TASK

### Task: Initialize Project Architecture Setup (PR-001)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Blocks all other development
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
**Dependencies**: None

### Your Mission:
Transform the current Create React App structure into a scalable, production-ready architecture that will support the full Wordvile game.

### Explicit Instructions:

1. **FIRST** - Update this file's header with:
   ```markdown
   **Last Updated**: [Current Date/Time]
   **Last Agent**: [Your Identifier]
   **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation
   **Active PR**: PR-001: Project Architecture Setup
   **Status**: IN_PROGRESS
   ```

2. **Analyze Current Structure**:
   ```bash
   # Document current file structure
   tree -I 'node_modules|build|.git' > architecture_audit.txt
   
   # Analyze bundle size
   npm run build
   npm run analyze
   ```

3. **Create Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/PR-001-architecture-setup
   ```

4. **Implement Architecture Improvements**:
   - [ ] Migrate to Vite (better performance than CRA)
   - [ ] Set up proper folder structure:
     ```
     src/
     ├── components/     # Reusable UI components
     ├── features/       # Feature-specific modules
     ├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
     ├── services/       # API and external services
     ├── store/          # State management
     ├── utils/          # Utility functions
     ├── types/          # TypeScript definitions
     ├── assets/         # Static assets
     └── styles/         # Global styles
     ```
   - [ ] Install and configure Zustand for state management
   - [ ] Set up module aliases in tsconfig.json
   - [ ] Create development/staging/production configs
   - [ ] Add comprehensive logging system (winston)

5. **Required Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Run all existing tests
   npm test
   
   # Verify build works
   npm run build
   
   # Test in development
   npm run dev
   
   # Create new architecture tests
   # Create src/__tests__/architecture.test.ts
   ```

6. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - [ ] Update README.md with new structure
   - [ ] Create ARCHITECTURE.md explaining decisions
   - [ ] Document all new npm scripts
   - [ ] Add JSDoc comments to new utilities

7. **Verification Checklist** (ALL must pass):
   - [ ] All existing features still work
   - [ ] Build size is same or smaller
   - [ ] Development server starts in <3s
   - [ ] Hot reload works properly
   - [ ] No TypeScript errors
   - [ ] All tests pass
   - [ ] Eye tracking still functions

8. **Commit and Update**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "PR-001: Implement scalable architecture

   - Migrated from CRA to Vite
   - Implemented modular folder structure
   - Added Zustand state management
   - Configured module aliases
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - All tests passing"
   
   git push origin feature/PR-001-architecture-setup
   ```

9. **Update This File** with completion status:
   ```markdown
   **Status**: COMPLETED
   **Completion Date**: [Date]
   **Next PR**: PR-002: Enhanced Eye Tracking System
